# Calblend Code of Conduct

Calblend is committed to a welcoming, safe, and inclusive community for
everyone—users, contributors, maintainers, and newcomers alike.

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in the
Calblend project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age,
body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experience
* Gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing courtesy and professionalism in all interactions

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments (public or private)
* The use of sexualized language or imagery and any unwelcome sexual attention
  or advances
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments; personal or political attacks
* Publishing others’ private information such as a physical or email address
  without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all Calblend project spaces—GitHub repos,
issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, chat channels, and social media—
and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in
public spaces.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior. They may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code,
wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code
of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when
appropriate.

## Reporting

If you witness or experience behavior that violates this Code of Conduct,
please report it to the maintainers at **conduct@calblend.dev**.  
All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter
of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in
determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this
Code of Conduct:

| Impact | Consequence |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Minor**<br>Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional. | Private warning and clarification of expected behavior. |
| **Moderate**<br>Repeated minor violations or a single serious incident. | Temporary ban from interactive spaces (issues, PRs, chats) for 1–7 days. |
